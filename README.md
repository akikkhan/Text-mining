# Text-mining using Machine Learning Techniques#

**Text Mining** or **text data mining** is the process of deriving important information from text. Typical text mining includes text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization,  entity relation modeling etc. Text mining is necessary for historical analysis, biomedical applications, software applications, academic applications etc. In our approach, we want to analyze texts from a popular question and answer based website i.e *Stack Exchange* and try to categorize the texts. We want to analyze some archived data of Stack Exchange (https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) using text classification. In our work, we will implement two techniques, *K- nearest neighbor* and *Na√Øve Bayes* for text classification and will compare their relative performances.
